<p>This document was researched and hand written by Tom 
Fisher circa 1950. It was transcribed by 
Billy Ward (2014). See Billy's footnote. </p>
<p>Place names can sometimes give a clue to the character 
and history of the subject, or the area they represent. They often provide links 
over many centuries with their originators and although some of them have passed 
through innumerable variations of spelling, patient research has made it 
possible to arrive at their original form.</p>
<p>In Britain generally the language of the Celts, Angle Saxon and Scandinavians have helped to establish place names 
associated with these people. Scotland has place names that can be traced to the 
invaders of the Welsh – Celts infiltration, and to the Scots and Picts, and the 
invaders from Norway. In Fife which was part of Southern Pictland, it is natural 
that place names of Pictish origin are predominant.The names that have come to us in Kinghorn and the 
surroundings, are worthy of consideration. After studying a book on the Gaelic 
names of Scottish towns I found by breaking down some of the Gaelic words I 
found that they had a close resemblance of most of the names of the parish of 
Kinghorn.</p>


<h5><li>G. = Gaelic</li>
<li>O.N. = Old Norse</li>
<li>W. = Welsh</li>
<li>M.E. = Medieval English (10<sup>th</sup> century)</li>
<li>Sc. = Scots.</li>
<li>L. = Latin</li></h5>


<p>Abden: This is the G. abaid &quot;Land of the Abbey&quot;this was the seat of the Abthane, or over thane an 
ancient office in the days of the &quot;Culdees&quot; or Columban religious order.</p>
<p>Green Brae: This takes its name from the hill 
over-looking the Abden Cottage and Orchard.</p>
<p>Birrels Wynd: This may have derived its name from the 
material made in the mill at the bottom of the Wynd, the name of the material 
was called &quot;Burel&quot;, a rough texture cloth. In Angus there is a town called 
Birrels Town that received its name from the same material.</p>
<p>Ladyburn Place: This roadway leading down to the Abden 
received its name from the burn that had it beginning in the North Myre, and 
also from the little spring that had the peculiar name of &quot;Nell’s Hole&quot;.</p>
<p>Parsons Croft: This may have been the part of ground at the top 
of Ladyburn Place, on this piece of ground stood a very old sand stone building 
that was a common building material during the 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> 
centuries.</p>
<p>Trowes: This is the G. &quot;troise&quot;, meaning &quot;across the 
middle of the land&quot; this may be the real meaning of this pathway as it crossed 
the Mill Lands.</p>
<p>The Crafts or St Leonards Lane: Crafts is the old Sc. 
Word for &quot;the field next to&quot;, this may be the case as it was next to the mill 
lands.</p>
<p>The Brig or St Leonards Place: The Brig was a suitable 
name for this part of the town. Under the &quot;Turnpike Act&quot; of 1750 this part of 
the town was raised to the level of the High Street and the old draw well was 
covered up and a low wall was built that made a convenient seat for the old men 
of the town. Now these old houses have been demolished and a modern block of 
houses have taken their place, but this block of houses won’t have the charm or 
character of the old.</p>
<p>Cunzie Neuk: According to most of the Historians of 
the Burgh they do not mention anything about a mint or the minting of coins. But 
according to enquiries being made by the daughter of Provost Smith, found that 
there is a record kept by the Guild of Goldsmith of Edinburgh that in a corner 
of &quot;Cunzie Neuk&quot; there was a mint for the minting of coins.</p>
<p>Trongate: This was a gate leading to the Tron, or the 
weighting machine. The &quot;Auld Hoose&quot; postal address was 16 The Tron at one time.</p>
<p>The Tron: The place of the weighting machine and where 
goods were bought and sold.</p>
<p>Nethergate: This was the last road leading to the 
shore and ferry at one time.</p>
<p>St James Place: This was the part of ground situated 
at the corner of Nethergate and the &quot;Gang&quot;. It takes its name from the Chapel 
and Hospital founded by Robert Pearson, one time a burgess of the town, who 
granted a piece of land for the support of a Chapel and Hospital, also for a 
chaplain for the Chapel of St James. It is quite possible that the old manse at 
the corner of the Harbour Road and Nethergate was a part of the same Chapel and 
Hospital granted by the said Donor.</p>
<p>The Gang: This was the road facing the shore, the name 
Gang is the Sc. Word for go or taken from the G. for the &quot;toothless entrance&quot;.</p>
<p>Quarrel Brae: This part of the braes is supposed to 
get its name from a battle fought here between the Danes and the Scots, but it 
may be derived from Sc. Quarry. At one time there may have been a quarry at the 
bottom of the brae. For according to the G. for gang means the toothless 
entrance, this may have been the entrance to the quarry.</p>
<p>The Muckle Hole: This was a large hollow at the west 
end of the Braes that had been worn away by the water from the Leeches Loch now 
&quot;the cemetery&quot; many centuries ago. At one time the town used this for the 
dumping of the town’s refuse, later they built a small esplanade to stop the sea 
from washing away the soil.</p>
<p>The Cave: This was a natural cavern in the side of the 
hill, but man had 
improved the entrance by hammer and chisel and by rounding the front of the 
cave.</p>
<p>The Harbour: Dates from early medieval times. For many 
years this was the main ferry between the South and the North, owing to the 
starting point of the old medieval track that joined up with one coming from 
Dunfermline to Falkland, also one going to St Andrews. This ferry was used by 
Archbishop Beaton and Sharp. During the French invasion of Fife, 
the French marched to Auchtertool and burnt the home of Kirkcaldy of Grange, 
named The Halyards Palace, then they marched to the Grange where they blew up 
the mansion house with gunpowder. Revenge came to Kirkcaldy when he made his 
descent upon the harbour of Kinghorn where he captured three French Supply 
ships, he put the crews to the sword and set fire to the French ship. (C. 1560).</p>
<p>The Boat Neuk: This was the corner of the harbour 
situated at the Kirk Craigs where the fishermen laid their boats up during the 
winter months or for the repairing of their boats.</p>
<p>Barton Buildings: At one time this was the Old Harbour 
Mill that was converted in to dwelling houses about the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> 
century. It received its name in honour of one of Scotland’s great Admirals Sir 
Andrew Barton who is said was born in Kinghorn, but the Bartons were a Leith 
family who may have had a house in the town.</p>
<p>Salmon Cottage: These two cottages enclosed by a high 
wall, at one time were used as a fish curing yard, and at one time would supply 
Edinburgh with fresh salmons. These were the days when the Forth abounded in 
porpoise and whales, and seals and salmon. Nowadays with the Forth being 
polluted from the refuse from the Cities and towns, fish are getting scarcer 
every day.</p>
<p>Carlin Head: M.E. and Old Norse. Kerling, old woman, 
fem, of karl &quot;churl&quot;, in Sc. Carl; so the name means the &quot;old woman’s&quot; with head 
added would then mean &quot;the old woman’s head&quot;</p>
<p>Parton Rocks: G. parton &quot;a little harbour&quot;, with rocks 
added would then mean &quot;the harbour rocks&quot;.</p>
<p>Pettycur: C. 
1150 Petioker, 1277 – 1610 – ocher, though 1268, Petecor (P.car, cuir, &quot;at the 
bend&quot;), as the O’ persists, probably O.G. pettecour, &quot;croft of extortion&quot;. i.e. 
high rented.</p>
<p>Old Inn and Hotel, Pettycur: At the beginning of the 
19<sup>th</sup> century the old inn couldn’t cope with the great influx of 
travellers between Leith and Pettycur. 
At that time the stage-coach and ferry was made to run to a time-table. A new 
hotel was built further up the road from the harbour to cope with further 
influxes of travellers. </p>
<p>The Salt Pans: The old salt pans were situated where 
the glass work now stands, at the turn of the century the salt pans were 
demolished to make room for the glass making industry.</p>
<p>Wellhouse Spa: The Wellhouse Spa during the 17<sup>th</sup> 
century was a popular place for the gentry taking the water from this famous 
spa. Dr. Anderson the King’s Physician wrote a treatise on this water. (He was 
the inventor of the once famous pills known by his name). We learn that it was 
impregnated with crystal gypsum, and nitre and that it was diuretic powerful 
enough to give &quot;vigour and strength to deliberated debilitated constitutions&quot;. 
&quot;Further it relieved such as are troubled with the difficulty of breathing, and 
allayeth all inflammations internal and external. Lastly that it might be taken 
in the morning after fasting, and at the rock from which issue from the 
appropriate remark could be more, 
regarding this catalogue of virtues that appears in the most charming hand- 
book &quot; The Fringes of Fife&quot;. From the ferry to the Spa was 
the right of way, now it only goes as far as the Lochties Bridge, from the west 
side of the bridge this is all private ground belonging to the land company of 
Edinburgh, who for many years supplied the sand for the building of the Naval 
Base at Rosyth, and also for private and local builders. This company stopped 
taking the sand from the foreshore after the second world war. Now the ground is 
used for a holiday camp. No longer does it go under the name of the Wellhouse 
Spa, now its postal address is the Sandhills.</p>
<p>King’s Mid End: In a little field near the monument, 
two stone cist’s or coffins were found, they belonged to the Beaker period, they 
now lie in the Museum of Edinburgh. During the 19<sup>th</sup> century a retired 
tea planter bought a piece of ground from Bruce of Grangehill for the building 
of a mansion house, before he did so the small waterfall had to be piped and ran 
underground before the house could be constructed. He planted the surrounding 
ground with trees and bushes. Now the mansion has been converted in to a hotel.</p>
<p>The King’s Craig: This was the cliff that the King was 
supposed to have fallen over when making his way to Kinghorn Tower, situated 
above the Harbour at Pettycur. There is no mention of the King falling over the 
cliff by Brice, the Abbot of Inchcolm in his history of Scotland.</p>
<p>Grangehill: This is the Latin name for &quot;church farm on 
the hill&quot;.</p>
<p>Slack Myre: This is the piece of ground that the farm 
buildings are built on. The name is derived from the Sc. 
Word slack &quot;loose&quot; myre &quot;marshes ground&quot;.</p>
<p>West Burn: This small stream divides the Rosslands 
from the Castleriggs, this stream made its way down by the old Tannery or the 
old Golf Club manufacturing business run by a Mr William Gibson at the beginning 
of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, from there down to the shore at the rock known 
as the Salmon rock.</p>
<p>Castleriggs: This piece of land was given to one by 
the name of Murdoch Shank, an outlaw, who found the Kings body. He later 
received a free pardon and given the land known as Castleriggs that stretches 
from the Loch to the West Burn and bounds in the East by the Kilcruik Lands down 
to the South at the Tannery. The part at the side of the loch was bought by the 
Burntisland Oil Co. for the constructing of the old Pug Railway.</p>
<p>Kilcruik Lands: This land consisted of the field from 
the Candleworks to Barclay Road and Kilcruik Road to the old Tannery or Bailiol 
Road.</p>
<p>Kirk Steads: This was the land stretching from the 
Templers Walk to the Cross Road, and from the Loch Road to Kilcruik Road or 
Townhead.</p>
<p>Gallow Plantian: This piece of ground was bought by 
the Burntisland Oil Company, also the loch. Their railway ran around the face of 
the hill and under the road to the Low Binn where the oil shale coal was put 
into retorts to extract the oil from the coal.</p>
<p>Candle Works: These works for at least ten years were 
kept busy making candles and other articles from the paraffin wax. Many of the 
painters during the winter time when work was hard to get found jobs waiting for 
them in the works. Unfortunately the Burntisland Oil Co. after ten years closed 
down the works at the Low Binn, 
owing to one of the mines being flooded. During the First World War they were 
turned into barracks until the war finished. 
Next Cameron of Silver Mill in Edinburgh opened up the works for preparing the 
hides for the motor car industry, this continued till the beginning of the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
World War. Now it is the Loch side Tannery works. </p>
<p>The Loch: This stretch of water was a source of energy 
for the many mills operating in the parish before the advent of steam. One of 
the oldest mills in Kinghorn was the one that had gone under the name of Pease 
Mill on the lower side of the Trowes. There is a charter that Edward the first 
of England had control of this mill and the surrounding land, presumably the 
&quot;Mill Lands&quot;. The loch is fed by many springs most of them situated at the west 
end of the loch, known as the Saught, or Willow trees. At one time this loch had 
a depth of 30 feet, but this is gradually being reduced by material from the 
springs.</p>
<p>Red Braes: This is the roadway leading to Kilrie, one 
road leads to Craigencalt and the other climbs the hill, the name Red Braes may 
have received its name from the colour of the earth.</p>
<p>Cant’s Hill: This is the hillside stretching from the 
North Road to the Ghostan, it’s other name was Tammy Lowrie hill, he was a local 
man who spent most of his spare time there.</p>
<p>Banchory: This is the G. name for a &quot; Sharp pointed 
hill&quot;</p>
<p>Pitteadie: G. name for this Tower and farm is eadann-ain 
&quot;a bit of land on the slope of the hill&quot; or hill face.</p>
<p>Ketry: C1198, Kallori, G. eille Mhoire, the virgin 
Mary’s Church.</p>
<p>Chapel Flat: This was a small field on the way to 
Auchtertool, this may refer to the Chapel of Kilrie.</p>
<p>Glassmount: This is the G. for glas monaclh or &quot;Grey 
Hill&quot; or &quot;mount&quot;, on one of the fields there stands two crude stones, they may 
be a monument to some warriors of the past, or they may represent some druidical 
temple that was replaced by the Christian faith, who took over the Culdee 
churches, this may be the case for not far from here was the chapel of the 
Virgin &quot;Mary’s&quot;.</p>
<p>Tyrie and Legmallee: The only remains of this mansion 
is the Garden walls, with graceful corner strengths and well built, 
and finely portioned gateways, the present mansion house stands on the site of 
the old. In older days Tyrie could boast of a church that went under the name of 
&quot;Ecclesia Sanctas Maria&quot;, now no longer to be seen. To this chapel from the Isle 
of May came St. Fillan to spend the rest of his days at the chapel of &quot;Ecclesia 
Sanctas Maria&quot;. It is known that he died and was buried somewhere in the Chapel 
grounds. The older people of the surrounding district found that the high 
sounding name difficult to pronounce, so they dubbed it Eggs Maline.</p>
<p>Seafield Tower: The present Tower was built on the 
site of a much older one, 
for according to an old charter of 1309, 
King Robert 1 granted to William Kinghorn the lands of Seafield. The Moultray of 
Seafield came from Markinch in 1513, when John Moultray of Markinch and Kinghorn 
was killed at the battle of Flodden. We find traces of this contentious race in 
various pleas and complaints and cautions. There were many traces of 
interchanging between the Moultrays and their neighbours. The family connection 
with Seafield ceased in 1626 when Robert Moultray sold the estate to Archbishop 
Law of Glasgow, and became the proprieter of the lands of Rescobie.</p>
<p>Vicar’s grange and Old Vicar’s grange: On the road 
leading to Seafield, Old Vicar’s grange was on the right hand side of the road, 
and Vicar’s grange was on the left. This estate belonged to the reader of the 
Kirk of Kinghorn. </p>
<p>The Myres, North Mid and Myres Park: These three 
fields were owned by the town and were let out to the highest bidders for 
grazing or for bleaching of material made in the mill of the burgh.</p>
<p>Bleaching Hill: This hill was a popular place for the 
bleaching of cloth by the people of the town, or by the mills for the bleaching 
of flax or linen.</p>
<p>Kilcruik Road: This is the name for a&quot;cell or chapel 
in the woods&quot;. Robert Sibbald in his history of Fife gave Kinghorn the name of 
Kilgorn meaning &quot;the church on the green headland&quot;.</p>
<p>David Brown of Fordell, Finmount and Vicars grange: 
His mother was Elisabeth Coutts of the Grange, daughter of Allen Coutts of the 
Grange. Vicars grange was purchased from Sir George Erskine of Invertiel, 
the Charter dating from 1630. David Brown died in 1643 and was succeeded by his 
sons David and John, and eventually by his daughter Christian. 
She married John Bruce of Wester Abden, 
a cadet of the Earlshall family, and with this union was chose the surname of 
Brown with Vicars grange. In1638 David Brown added the lands of Wester Grass to 
his estate, these being described in the deeds of Sasine as lying in the parish 
of Kinghorn, between the Vicars grange and the sea on the South side of the 
stream running eastwards from the courtgate to the sea.</p>
<p>Grange: The name of this estate is taken from the Latin 
for &quot;The Church Farm&quot;. This estate had many owners including the Sandilands and 
Coutts, but Kirkcaldy of Grange and the Hallyairds at Auchtertool were the most 
famous of all the owners. During the invasion of Fife by the French who arrived 
at the Hallyairds and finding no one there set the place on fire and destroyed 
all the wall covering and all the contents of the mansion, from there they 
travelled down to the Grange where they blew up the house with gunpowder. But 
Kirkcaldy got revenge when he was informed that three French Supply ships were 
in the harbour at Kinghorn, he descended on the harbour and put the crews of the 
ships to the sword and then set fire to the ships. The present building baronial 
in style, shows a circular tower with the date of 1687, with the monogram carved 
on the kitchen door. There is an entrance from the kitchen, opening into a vault 
and underground passage leading to, as some say, to Seafield Cave.</p>
<p>Bow Butts: This 16<sup>th</sup> century mansion stands 
on the site of an earlier building, across the road from it was the Bow Butt 
farm and orchard and their other field was situated at the Cross Roads, a small 
field on the right hand side of the road leading to Craigencalt. Inside the 
grounds of Bow Butts at the corner of Eastgate and the Kirkcaldy Road stood a 
small pond fed from the water of the Lady burn, but this was filled in by the 
owner at the beginning of the century, now the gardeners house and garage has 
taken its place.</p>
<p>The Butts: Built on to the end of the orchard wall was 
another wall about ten to twelve feet high, this enclosure of ground was used 
for the practice of Archery. On the side of the Loch Road was a depression where 
there was a spring of fresh water, this spring would be a welcome to the archers 
for the quenching of their thirst. This well had the peculiar name of &quot;Nells 
Hole&quot;.</p>
<p>Templers Walk: This pathway dates back to Medieval 
times and it may go back to the days when this was the starting point between 
the South and North. This track ran along the side of the Orchard across the 
Loch Road and through a field belonging to Craigencalt, across a style at Cants 
Hill, or to give its other name, Tammy Lowries hill, from there to Banchory, 
then to Abbotshall and Chapel, Clunie, Dogton, then joining up with a track from 
Dunfermline at Kinglassie, from there to Walkerton where it joined up with a 
track from West Wemyss, then made its way to Falkland and St Andrews. </p>
<p>Barclay Road: This roadway was constructed at the 
beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, this road was named after the cottage 
at the top of the Gallowgate. One of the Barclays was the town clerk for over 20 
years. This roadway cut through a part of the Glamis Castle Gardens that was on 
the opposite side of the Loch Burn.</p>
<p>The Cut or Castle Wynd: The opening through the 
hillside was made either in the latter half of the 18<sup>th</sup> century or 
the earlier part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. This enabled the stage coach an 
easier route to join up with the North Road. It seems that the old road had gone 
by the High Street, Eastgate, Glamis Lane, up the side of Splash Mill (Hays 
Joiners Shop) to connect with the old Mid Road to Burntisland. The other road 
had gone by Eastgate, Gallowgate, joining up with the North Road.</p>
<p>Baliol Road or Tannerie Toll House and Cottage: The 
old Toll House stood up the top of the Castle Wynd and Baliol Road. Under the 
Tampots Act of 1750, 
where road improvements were carried out, 
and roads in certain parts of the town were in place for the payment of tolls. 
The Toll House and cottage were demolished about 1930 to make way for a modern 
housing scheme.</p>
<p>Tannery: This work was situated where the Gibson Golf 
Club makers works stands today. A reference to the ship Cursour ,with a cargo of 
hides appeared in a cautan of 1599. There a cargo of hides &quot;now in a boat 
belonging to the Weemysous&quot; shall be transferred from the St. Peter to the 
Cursour, but the cause of the transference does not transpire. The water for the 
tanning came from the North Burn.</p>
<p>Leeches Loch and Witches Hill: During the building of 
the railway a large part of the rocks were cut away. Leeches Loch was a dismal 
stretch of water drain. Later the town sold it to the Parish Council for a new 
cemetery. At the top of the cemetery at the part that the railway blasted away, 
was the part where the witch was burned, her name was &quot; Katherine Wallenge&quot;, in 
the year 1667. </p>
<p>Pettycur: C1150. Petiocker, Old G. &quot;pette cuir&quot; &quot;a bit 
of land at the turn or bend&quot;, but where the O is persistent it may mean the &quot; 
croft of extortion&quot; The Harbour was, of old, a landing place for Royalty, as the 
Royal Castle or Tower was built on the top of the hill overlooking the Harbour. 
Many parts of this headland has been claimed for the siting of this Tower, but 
the most feasible one is the one mentioned above, with the sea and the hillside 
to the south and the Leeches Loch to the west, and the lands known as the 
Jousting Lands to the north. This made a fine defensive place for his Castle and 
Tower. </p>
<p>Old Inn: The old Inn and stables were converted into 
houses after the ferry was transferred to Burntisland. At the height of the 
ferry this old Inn would house many a landed gentleman, also Royalty, before the 
hotel further up the road was built. At the end of the Inn stood a lean- 
to sort of house, this was a kiln for the smoking of fish or herring. Now their 
old house has been swept away and a refreshment has taken their place. The basin 
across the road from the old inn and the old harbour masters house, or 
superintendent’s house was demolished and the material dumped into the basin. 
Now this is used as a car park.</p>
<p>Brick House: This house was built on a spur of rock at 
the ness. It was a handy landmark for the fishermen, if you could see the Brick 
House and the Seafield Tower in your sight you sail clear of any rocks.</p>
<p>The Hotel: This hotel was built to accommodate the 
many travellers using the ferry. When the stage coach was made to run to a time 
table in conjunction with the ferry this brought a greater influx of travellers 
to the ferry. During stormy weather most of the houses of the town were over 
flowing with travellers waiting to cross to Leith.</p>
<p>The Battery: This Battery was constructed during the 
latter half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, then, at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> 
century the Government bought some acres of ground at the top of the Crying Hill 
where they constructed a few gun emplacements. After the 2<sup>nd</sup> World 
War the High and Low Batteries were demolished and modern houses built on the 
ground that once, in conjunction with Inchkeith, 
held the key to the defence of the Forth. </p>
<p>Anne.S. Swann’s House: This large free-stone built 
house, built to a plan of the Authoress, Anne S. 
Swan for a holiday home for her husband and family. It was a nice retreat from 
the grime and dust and busy life of London and to get the invigorating air of 
this seaside resort. Annie. S. Swan was one of the most prolific writers of her 
day. &quot;The peoples Friend&quot; to which she contributed was to be found in nearly 
every home. Her first home in Kinghorn was &quot;Carlowrie&quot;, and then &quot;Aldersyd&quot;, and 
from there to the Anchorage. After the tragic death of her son she sold the 
Anchorage to the local ship builder, John Fletcher for the sum of £700, who 
later sold it to Gregor McGregor the head of the Fife Education Authority for 
the sum of £1700. This is a little story about John Fletcher getting old Tommy 
Lawrence to paint the woodwork in some of the rooms of the house. After a few 
days Fletcher paid old Tommy a visit. Looking into one of the rooms he gave out 
a roar, &quot; Hi Lawrence were the watery waves coming into the bay&quot;, old Tommy 
asked &quot;why Mr Fletcher?&quot;, Fletchers reply was &quot;You have more waves on this 
woodwork than there is entering the bay&quot;. </p>
<p>The Port: This name means gateway. That would be 
before the Burntisland Road was made and the only road to the ferry was by 
Pettycur Road.</p>
<p>Glue Works: These works were situated where the 
Rosslands tea gardens now stand. They belonged to the Kinghorn family of Darneys. 
These works later closed down and were transferred to Edinburgh. Henry Darney 
gifted some fine oil paintings to the town that can be seen in the town hall 
today.</p>
<p>The School: This school has seen many additions added 
to its original octagonal dome that crowned the entrance hall and the museum and 
the quaintly spired clock tower that remains singularly attractive. With the 
coming of the railway, 
the Burgh bowling green and part of the school ground and buildings (1846) and 
at one time &quot;Rose Cottage&quot; with an entrance through a large Pend was used as an 
infant’s class room, this was in the year 1872, also there was a small school 
held in the old mill at the harbour near Barton Buildings, these places were 
used until the infants class rooms were built beside the Burntisland Road.</p>
<p>Rossland Place: This part of the town contained many 
stables and a hotel. Bobby McNorgan had his stable facing the railway, the hotel 
was next to the Church, 
other stables were situated where the West End Café is now. These were the days 
when one could hire a horse and a man for 2d a mile, I suppose the charge for 
the man was for him to bring back the horse.</p>
<p>High Street: Before the Turnpike Act of 1750, the High 
Street was lower on the seaward side, but with the Act if 1750 the High Street 
was raised to its present level. If you study some of the old houses on the 
seaward side of the street you will see that they had to build a retaining wall 
in front of some of the houses. Now these old houses are gradually disappearing 
and the High Street is losing its homeliness that the modern bricks of houses 
will never acquire, 
nor mellow with age.</p>
<p>Gallowgate, Eastgate, North Overgate and South 
Overgate: The word gate should be spelled &quot;gaet&quot;, this is the old Sc. Word for 
road, and had nothing to do with gates. The old Sc. Word for gates was Ports.
</p>
<p>Pease Mill: Was situated on the lower side of the 
Trowes with the typical circular shape of the kiln rising above its desolate 
buildings. The entrance to this old mill was by an opening half way down South 
Overgate. Over the old mill was the date 1751, this was an indication of 
rebuilding only as the mill was one of Kinghorn’s earliest and most reliable 
asset of the burgh. A writ of 1614 show that Patrick Kirkcaldie of Grange and 
Western Abden held the Jousting Lands &quot; along with Mclindins de Kinghorn&quot;, 
and some other properties. Edward the 2<sup>nd</sup> of England held the mill of 
Kinghorn for a while.</p>
<p>Bruce Street: This street received its name from 
Robert Bruce who had married a granddaughter of Kirkcaldy of Grange, and as a 
marriage dowry, he received land known as western Abden. His house stood at the 
top of South Overgate where the present Ship Tavern now stands. Robert’s 
brother, John Bruce was eminent as a scholar, and became Professor of Logic at 
Edinburgh University. Eventually he held several important government 
appointments and did splendid services as an author and in arranging the chaos 
of the state papers offices. Along with Sir John B. Blair he shared the 
reversion of the patent of Kings Printer for Scotland and this earned him the 
nickname of Bible Bruce. Thus when T.Fisher built the Ship Tavern on the site of 
Bruce’s house the saying became &quot;from spiritual to spirits&quot;.</p>
<p>South Overgate: During the demolishing of the houses 
at South Overgate and Tron they came across some under- ground caverns. These 
would have been reservoirs for the mills, for starting up in the morning. </p>
<p>The Shipyard: This shipyard was started by a Kirkcaldy 
man who had a small shipyard at the bottom of Heggies Wynd at the Links. He 
later moved to Kinghorn. The next owner was the Scotts of Greenock who faded in 
1909. The yard was started up again by John Hatcher but did not last very long 
and no longer were ships built there.</p>
<p>Bellypuff: This may be the G.for baile, poor man’s 
house, or it may be belly for the farm near the village with puff added. 
Bellypuff.</p>
<p>Apple and Pear:` These two holes in the rocks may 
have been made by erratic seas, otherwise large pond stone that through the ages 
had been made by the action of the sea and gradually made these round holes in 
the rock.</p>
<p>Courting Rock: This was a favourite place for 
courting couples in days gone by, also for the young women before the first 
world war, who with their knitting or crocheting passed away the time during the 
summer months.</p>
<p>Hoch ma Toch and Burgh Boundary: This is the Gaelic 
for the Lime Stone Bay. At one time this had a large quantity of marine lime 
stone. In the shale a little to the west of the little spring of water that runs 
down the rock, it was possible at one time to find the bone and teeth of 
Carnivorous fishes of that period. The little stream that makes it way down from 
the railway to the little bay is the burgh boundary.</p>
<p>Lime Kiln, Beach and Rock and old Kiln: This part of the beach supplied, 
at one time, all of 
the lime required for building purposes. To this day you can follow the road 
from the beach to as far as the Apple and the Pear, from there it follows where 
the railway had built the retaining wall that was washed away during a storm, 
the road then crossed over the tip of the Bellypuff, that before shipyard, 
made up the ground from the material taken from the shipyard, was extended when 
it came around the back of the Kirk.</p>
<p>A bit of Burntisland history: In 1654, a horse race 
was ran annually on St. Peters day, from the East Port to Pettycur, instituted 
and continued until 1812. George Sanders. The miniaturist painter: George 
Sanders was born in Kinghorn in the year 1774. After an apprenticeship to a 
coach painter, he later was occupied principally in painting miniatures and 
teaching drawing. In 1807 he went to London and almost at once became the 
popular miniaturist of the day. Members of the Royal Household were amongst his 
sitters. From 1812 he turned his attentions almost entirely to painting life 
size portraits in oil. In this branch of art his work was also in great demand. 
He died in London in the year 1846.</p>
<p>Kinghorn: In 1849 there were nine public houses and an 
inn at Pettycur. It seems the most popular of the public houses was the &quot;Lion&quot;, 
the &quot;The Three Crowns&quot; and the &quot;New Inn&quot; at Pettycur. The town as a whole was 
turned into a place of entertainment as the passengers stayed by tide and storm. 
The town could also supply the travellers with saddled horses, as many as 60 
were kept in the town. Now the ferry has disappeared and Pettycur has fallen 
into decay and the public houses have been reduced to three and two hotels.</p>
<p>The Curse of Kinghorn: This curse was laid on the town 
by an old woman who usually sat on a low wall above the steps leading down to 
Cunzie Neuk. It happened when the mill girls were making their way to the 
wishing well in the Doric Glen. One of the girls said to the old woman &quot;come 
Maggie and wish you were young again&quot;, she replied &quot;wish well for yourself for 
the day will come when the work in the mill will prosper for a while and then 
fade&quot;</p>
<p>Town Hall: This building was created in the Tudor 
style, and was at one time was the most important building in the Burgh. It was 
designed by Hamilton of Edinburgh and erected at a cost of £2500.oo this 
including the jail and the Janitors house, nowadays this money would not buy a 
small bungalow. The Town Hall was built on the site of the old Tolbooth or St. 
Leanords Tower which was struck by lightning at the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> 
century. The present building was built in the year 1828.</p>
<h5>Proverb of Kinghorn:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Dysart for coal and saut</li>
<li>Pathhead for meat and maut</li>
<li>Kirkcaldy for lassies braw</li>
<li>Kinghorn for breaking the law</li>
</ul>
<p>Kinghorn for reasons which are not clear, was one of 
the poorest of the Royal Burghs of the East Coast and seemed to have a bad name 
in days of old.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kinghorn for cursing and swearing</li>
<li>Burntisland for curing herring</li>
</ul>
<p>As Burntisland no longer cures, it may be helped that 
Kinghorn no longer curses. How was this place better thought of than by the 
people. The fishes despised it long for it’s poverty in fish, and said of it. 
&quot;Kinghorn bliss&quot; (an enclosed bay): a muckle dish and little in it. </p>
<p>Or as another person put it. &quot;It’s like Kinghorn, nae 
muckle worth.</p>
<p>It’s better neighbours declared it’s sin in these 
lines. &quot;Here stands a kirk without a steeple. A drunken priest and graveless 
people.</p>
<p>The passengers seemed to have fought shy of its ferry, 
for it was said. &quot;Their many speir the road for Kinghorn sat kin it all the way 
to Pettycur&quot;</p>
<p>Note a few genealogies and internments at Kinghorn 
(Translated from Latin)</p>
<p>John Scodro, his son died at Kinghorn, and was buried 
there. John had three sons, namely Adam, John and Bert, Adam truly remaining at 
Kinghorn, and after the coming of Baliol into Scotland, was slain in the 
Kirkyaird and was buried there. Genealogy of John son of Adam. &quot;Adam, son of 
John Scordo elder, died at Kinghorn, and was buried there. John, 
his son, lives and remains there.</p>
<p>Genealogy of Brendin Paddying. &quot;Seathune, son of 
Edward died at Pelkyochryir, and was buried at Kinghorn. John, the brewer, his 
son died in Petycuir, and is buried at Kinghorn, Malethy, his son died at 
Kaskybarren, and is buried at Kinghorn.</p>
<p>Genealogy of the son of John Malethy. Malethy son of 
Gilgrewed, the fore said, died at Gathmilk and is buried at Kinghorn.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical Notices. There seems little information 
of the two churches of Easter and Wester Kinghorn. Prior to the reformation 
(1502), a document at Dunfermline stated that this would be known as Wester 
Kinghorn to distinguish it from the one in Kinghorn, called at that time 
Kinghorn Easter. The former (Kinghorn) was the name of the Parish but the 
ancient name of the town was Barterland or Burtiland, in the printed &quot; 
Requintrum de Dunfermline&quot; there are three deeds by the Bishop of St. Andrews, 
two in the 12<sup>th</sup> century and one in the 13<sup>th</sup> century, 
confirming the grants of the church of Kinghorn Wester to the Abbey of 
Dunfermline. In a taxation of the 13<sup>th</sup> century there are the 
following entries: The Kirk of Kinghorn paroa (small) to be valued at e.s. (100 
shillings, that of Kinghorn magne (great) is valued at £X.merks (£45-6-8 Scot.). 
Those values would accrue to the Abbey of Dunfermline to which these churches 
belong to, by gifts 
of the Bishops. </p>
<p>Local Medieval Tracks. The Broad ferry, as the ferry 
between Leith and Kinghorn was named, was the most popular of all the ferries of 
the Forth between the South and the North for it was the starting point for an 
old medieval track that joined up with a track coming from Dunfermline to 
Falkland, also one going to St. Andrews, often used by Archbishop Beaton and 
Sharp. These old tracks were used long before the Romans came to Britain. It 
seems probable that some of the tracks formed by the prehistoric people of Fife, 
these were also used by our Pictish ancestors. A tribe of the latter the 
Horesttic occupied this part of Scotland when the Romans were here and no doubt 
such tracks aided the latter to penetrate well into Fife and also to the shores 
of the Tay. </p>
<p>St. Fillan: From the Island of May, so far as the 
history is traceable, came the priory of Pet-Wymess, &quot;The settlement in the 
caves&quot; it is associated in its earliest day with St. Priscan and here lived St. 
Fillan, of Fife, who has been almost inextricably confused with two other Saints 
of the same name. St. Fillan called the &quot;Leper&quot; through the misreading, and St. 
Fillan of Galloway and Strathclyde. St Fillan, rose to be Abbot of Pittenweem. 
It is at least known with certainty where he died, for it is recorded that in 
his old age he retired to &quot;Disent&quot; of Tyrus where he passed away. &quot;Tyrus&quot; is 
Tyrie, situated in the valley behind Kinghorn. It may be that his dust lies in 
the obliterated church yard at Legmaline on the land of Tyrie. This place was 
named in 1169 as Ecclessmalee or the church of St. Maline, the same name which 
appears in the name of the famous Belgium City. </p>
<p>Johny Stocks, the dwarf who followed Patie Birnie. O’ 
Johny Stocks, what comes of thee ? I’m sure that it breaks thy heart and dee Thy 
Birnie’s gone, there’ll never be her blithe, nor able To spook they short laughs 
merrily Upon the table</p>
<p>The fiddler followed the Kinghorn Regiment to the 
battle of Bothwell Bridge. At Bothwell Brig. He gaed to fight But being wise as 
he was wight The thought it showed a soul but slight Darthy is starid And let 
the gun powder wrang his site Or fiddlers hand Right pawkely he left the plain 
Nor ower his shoulder looked again But couried ower moss and muir amain And to 
Auld Reekie straight And told how many who were slain Before they fought</p>
<p>The effegie of Pattie Birnie, famous fiddler of 
Kinghorn.</p>
<p>Wha gants the leiges gaff and girn Aft till the cock 
from lain the morn The path his wads and mirth were pernie He roo’d these things 
were langest worn The large ale barrel way his kirn ay’ And faithfully he temed 
his horn.</p><br>

<p><b>Footnote by Billy Ward</b> - I believe I got most of it as 
it was written, maybe a few words towards the end are not quite correct, but 
they can be changed if necessary.</p>
<p>I found this very interesting indeed and I certainly 
learned a lot about the &quot;Place names of Kinghorn&quot;. One in particular was Birrels 
Wynd where I grew up and lived for 21 years, I now know where the name came from 
and why Birrels only has one L. My teachers always accused me of spelling it 
incorrectly.</p>
<p>So thanks to Tom Fisher for hand writing this, no easy 
task in his day.</p>
<p>Who was Tom Fisher? We know after reading this that T. 
Fisher built the Ship Tavern, probably early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Mrs 
Tulloch I knew was born in the ship in the year 1912, so after speaking to 
Charlie I found out that Mrs Tulloch’s Mother was a Fisher, so we thought that T 
Fisher would have been her Grandfather or Uncle. No doubt more information will 
unfold on this one.</p>
<p>When did he write this? He does mention a couple of 
things that relate to the time he wrote this, namely: West End Café was 
operating then, the he mentioned the Rosslands Tea Gardens, then there was W. 
Gibson Golf Club Makers (The Cleek Works). Gibsons closed in 1955 so that is the 
latest date that it could have been, the other two went on a bit longer than 
that. He also mention the Second World War so that would make it, my opinion, 
between 1945 and 1955, and if it was, then somebody must remember him.<br>

<a name="Kinghorn_Bottleworks"></a><h4>Kinghorn Bottleworks</h4>

Around 1901 Wm. Bailey (Mid-Lothian Glass Works, Portobello) built a bottle manufacturing plant on the site of an old Saltworks at Pettycur Bay.  It was closed about a year later. The factory was then re-opened in 1908 
by the Kinghorn Bottle Co.<br><br>  In 1937 the Kinghorn Bottle Co. was taken over by United Glass.  They owned ten glass factories, numbered from 0 to 9.  <h5><li>0 = Harlow</li><li>1 = New Cross</li><li>2 = Sherdley</li>
<li>3 = Ravenhead</li><li>4 = Castleford</li><li>5 = Shettleston</li><li>6 = Brimsdown</li><li>7 = Kinghorn</li><li>8 = Alloa</li><li>9 = Peasley</li></h5><br> The factory number was used to identify their products, for example,
 UG 7 for Kinghorn. <br><br>

The Kinghorn furnace was rebuilt at a cost of one million pounds in 1980.  The following year United Glass announced that it would be closing the factory in April 1982 with 

the loss of 145 jobs. <br><br>

<a name="Harry_Julian"></a><h4>Harry Julian by Billy Ward</h4>

My only memory of Mr Julian was when I went to Kinghorn Primary School for the first time in August 1940. He was Headmaster then. I was standing at the front gate, probably wondering what to do when he came along and picked me up, put me on his shoulders and carried me up to the Infant School. He left the school not long after that to take up another position within the education system. The other memory I have of him was when I joined the scouts in 1947 and for the next six years I went to the Scout Hall ( Julian Memorial Hall) every Friday night where there was a painting of Harry Julian hanging on the wall with the words “Big Chief” written at the bottom.<br>
Here are some of the records that I picked up from Scout Records and books about Kinghorn.<br>
Harry Julian was the founder of Kinghorn Scouts and also a contemporary with Baden Powell (founder of the Boy Scouts). He visited Sweden and Hungary with the scouts. Kinghorn had special connections with Baden Powell, and Harry Julian was on the first ever special training course called “the Wood Badge Course”, run by Baden Powell. Jim Basham was on the first ever wood badge course to be held in Scotland.<br>
Mr Harry Julian came to Kinghorn from Plymouth to become a member of staff at Kinghorn Primary School in 1907. Kinghorn Scouts were formed in 1910. When the First World War broke out in 1914, Harry Julian joined the Royal Scots and took part in the Battle of the Somme in which he was wounded. In the latter part of the War, he served in Mesopotamia.<br> On demobilisation in 1919, with the rank of Major, he returned to Kinghorn School as Headmaster. He became very much involved in the Scout Movement and had responsible positions in jamborees held at Wembley, Birkenhead, Hungary, Sweden and Holland. He was awarded the highest Scout decoration the “Silver Wolf”, by Lord Baden Powell. When the Second World War started in 1939, he was put in charge of Air Raid precautions for the district and worked tirelessly for the safety of the local community. He died in 1943. As a token of appreciation for his work on behalf of the Scouts and the people of Kinghorn the Scout Hall was to be named the Julian Memorial Hall.</p><br><br>

<a name="Daisy_Fields"></a><h4>Daisy Fields by Nellie Phillips</h4>

<p><li>I wandered out on a summer’s day</li>
<li>Towards the Easter Braes</li>
<li>The cheerful guard at the station</li>
<li>Stopped me on my way<li><br>

<li>“Where are you off to this bright morn?”</li>
<li>Said he with a friendly smile</li>
<li>“I’m off to walk to the daisy beds</li>
<li>An hour to beguile”</li><br>

<li>So with a laugh he waves me on</li>
<li>And I stroll to the Belly Puff</li>
<li>To find it almost full to the top</li>
<li>With waves most high and rough</li><br>

<li>The Apple and Pear I saw on the rock</li>
<li>And the mark of a Cloven Hoof</li>
<li>I thought I was in enchanted land</li>
<li>With the sky above my roof</li><br>

<li>The curlew called and the seagulls fed</li>
<li>And the wee flowers smiled at me</li>
<li>Then when I reached the Daisy Beds</li>
<li>I heard the honey bee</li><br>

<li>‘Twas there I looked in a mirror pool</li>
<li>Where crabs and starfish abound</li>
<li>Where the seaweed waved and mussels clung</li>
<li>With anemones bright around</li><br>

<li>On the beach I found a fossil old</li>
<li>Pebbles shiny and bright</li>
<li>And, oh, I thought them jewels of gold</li>
<li>To fill me with delight</li><br>

<li>So if you have some time to spare</li>
<li>And wish to be like me</li>
<li>Then take a walk to the Daisy Beds</li>
<li>And see all that I could see</li><br></p>
