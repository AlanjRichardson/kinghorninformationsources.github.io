          <h3>Tribute by his friend, Bill Ward</h3>
          <p>John Braid – not too many people in Kinghorn will remember him, but I will never forget him.</p>
          <p>We first met in 1938 when I was three years old and John was five. I had moved to 2 Birrels Wynd and John lived down the road at Old Abden, a nice normal family – Mum, Dad and two sisters, Bunty and Margaret. From the moment we met we became great friends and he certainly looked after me.</p>
          <p>We went everywhere together. We played football as much as possible and he also took me to see the Rovers play at Stark’s Park for many years. When we got a bit older we started going to see the Fife Flyers at the Kirkcaldy ice rink. We started in 1947 and went up to 1952, never missing a home game. We loved it.</p>
          <p>He also took me to Edinburgh on several occasions, which was a big deal in those days. We got the ferry from Burntisland to Granton and the tram up into Edinburgh. John treated me all the way – I would never have been able to do all these things without John’s generosity.</p>
          <p>John left school in 1948 and got a job at Craigencalt Farm, where he worked until he was old enough to drive. He then worked for Grosset’s driving their lorry; his dad also drove one of the lorries.</p>
          <p>He was called up for National Service in July 1951, aged 18. He joined the Black Watch at Perth, where he did all his training. In June 1952 he sailed from Crail Harbour aboard the troopship <em>USS General John Pope</em> to Korea, along with lots of other young Scots on their way to fight in a war that they knew very little about.</p>
          <p>I received a letter and a couple of photos of him on his way to Korea. He had celebrated his 19th birthday on the ship. That was the last contact that I had from John.</p>
          <p>I was at our Summer Scout Camp in Pitlochry in July 1952. On the last day of the camp our Scoutmaster, Jim Basham, and his assistant, George Hill, took me to one side and told me that my pal John had been killed in action only one week after he arrived. I was devastated, and I could not believe I would never ever see him again.</p>
          <p>So many young men died there and I am still not sure why we were there. The South and North Koreans never got on then – and more than seventy years later they still don’t get on.</p>
          <p>One other Kinghorn lad was on the same ship as John: Alex (“Ali”) Edmiston. He survived and came back with three stripes and a few medals. He returned to play goalkeeper for Dundee United. He was a real local character.</p>
          <p>John’s name can be seen on our local War Memorial, all on its own at the back nearest the church. I often think about him and how his life would have been – or how it should have been – if it hadn’t been for a silly war.</p>
