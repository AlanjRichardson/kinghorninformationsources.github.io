<h4>History</h4>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The first human inhabitants appeared on the shores of the Firth of Forth about 10,000 years ago they were hunter-gatherers. Later, the Neolithic Picts arrived and introduced herding and cultivation to the area. Kinghorn, with its fertile land, abundant, fresh, water, and access to marine resources, was likely a tribal settlement for centuries. Eventually, the Scots replaced the tribes and united the country, creating the Scottish monarchy.</p>

<p>Kinghorn rose to prominence around the early/mid 13th century when it became a favoured royal hunting ground and a castle was built, there is a question of where it was built but the weight of evidence suggests it was near the loch burn on the rising gound where Burt Avenue is today. Kinghorn received a confirmatory charter from King Alexander 111 in 1285 elevating the village to one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Scotland.  Tragically in 1286 the King was killed when he fell off his horse whilst returning from Edinburgh to Kinghorn Castle to be with his wife Yolande. It was said that one Murdoch Schank (Schanck) discovered and looked after King Alexander 111's body. The Schank family were an ancient family who came from the Land of Schank in Midlothian.  It is also said that Robert the Bruce who reigned from 1306 - 1329 awarded Murdoch Schank the estate of Castlerigg in Kinghorn in recognition of this service to the throne.  Murdoch and his family appear to have taken up residence in Kinghorn in 1319.  The genealogy of the Schanks from then until 1884 can be accessed see the links below.</p>
 
<p>Kinghorn Castle was eventually gifted to the Lyon family (Glamis Castle Angus) in the 15th century which is probably when it became known as Glamis Tower/Castle.  The castle then swapped hands several times and during this period appears to have been used as a defensive position by French troops in a skirmish with reformation forces.  The castle was eventually returned to the Lyons and it is recorded that in 1606 Patrick Lyon was awarded the title Earl of Kinghorne by James the V1 and that he owned the old castle of the Kingâ€™s Horn at the town of Kinghorn it was also recorded that the castle was a ruin with only its walls remaining.</p><br>

<p>Important people of the time who attended the unveiling were: Senator James G. Blaine a Republican who served as United States Secretary of State on two occasions 1881 then 1889 -1892. In June 1887 he, his wife and daughters sailed to Europe visiting several countries the final one being Scotland where they stayed at the summer home of Andrew Carnegie.  Carnegie was a Dunfermline born Scottish-American industrialist, business magnate and philanthropist, he led the expansion of the American steel industry in the late 19th century and became one of the richest Americans in history. Lord Elgin, who was granted the Freedom of the Burgh of Kinghorn, subsequently became the Viceroy of India from 1894-1899.</p>
