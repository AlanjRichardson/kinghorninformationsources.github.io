<h4>History</h4>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>The shores of the Firth of Forth witnessed the emergence of it's first human inhabitants some 10,500 years ago, a community of hunter-gatherers. Subsequently, the Neolithic Picts brought herding and cultivation to the region, with Kinghorn, blessed with fertile land, abundant freshwater, and proximity to marine resources, likely serving as a tribal settlement for centuries. The Scots later supplanted the tribes, forging a unified nation under the banner of the Scottish monarchy.</p>

<p>Kinghorn's ascent to prominence developed during the 12th and 13th centurys when the area surrounding the town became a favoured royal hunting ground.  This royal patronage culminated in the construction of a castle. While the exact location of the castle remains debated, prevailing evidence suggests its existence near the loch burn, now Burt Avenue. In 1285, King Alexander III granted a confirmatory charter, elevating Kinghorn to one of Scotland's earliest Royal Burghs. Tragedy befell in 1286 when King Alexander III met his demise, having fallen from his horse en route from Edinburgh to Kinghorn Castle. Legend has it that Murdoch Schank, from the ancient Schank family of Midlothian, discovered and cared for the king's body. In recognition, Robert the Bruce reportedly bestowed upon Murdoch Schank the estate of Castlerigg in Kinghorn in 1319.  The genealogy of the Schanks from then until 1884 can be accessed, see the links below.</p>
 
<p>Kinghorn Castle was eventually gifted to the Lyon family (Glamis Castle Angus) in the 15th century which is probably when it became known as Glamis Tower/Castle.  The castle then swapped hands several times and during this period appears to have been used as a defensive position by French troops in a skirmish with reformation forces.  The castle was eventually returned to the Lyons and it is recorded that in 1606 Patrick Lyon was awarded the title Earl of Kinghorne by James the V1 and that he owned the old castle of the Kingâ€™s Horn at the town of Kinghorn it was also recorded that the castle was a ruin with only its walls remaining.</p>

<p>Prominent figures present at the unveiling ceremony included Senator James G. Blaine, a distinguished Republican who served as the United States Secretary of State in two separate terms, first from 1881 and then from 1889 to 1892. In June 1887, Senator Blaine, accompanied by his wife and daughters, embarked on a noteworthy European journey, exploring various countries. Their final destination was Scotland, where they were hosted at the summer residence of none other than Andrew Carnegie.</p>

<p>Carnegie, a Scottish-American industrialist, business magnate, and philanthropist born in Dunfermline, played a pivotal role in the late 19th-century expansion of the American steel industry. His remarkable success led him to become one of the wealthiest Americans in history.</p>

<p>Also in attendance was Lord Elgin, who received the esteemed Freedom of the Burgh of Kinghorn. Subsequently, he assumed the role of Viceroy of India from 1894 to 1899, adding another significant chapter to his distinguished career.</p>
