    <h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
  <section id="prehistoric">
    <h4>Prehistoric Beginnings</h4>
    <p>
      Following the end of the last Ice Age, around <strong>10,500 years ago</strong>, the shores of the Firth of Forth witnessed the arrival of their first human inhabitants.
      These were small communities of <strong>Mesolithic hunter-gatherers</strong>, living by fishing, hunting, and gathering shellfish and nuts. Archaeological evidence
      from across Fife — including the great shell midden at <em>Morton</em>, near Fife Ness, and flint scatters along the Eden Estuary and Tentsmuir sands — shows that these
      early people established seasonal camps along the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      From about <strong>4000 BC</strong>, the Neolithic period brought farming: communities built stone tombs, cleared woodland for crops, and raised livestock.
      Later, in the <strong>Bronze Age (c. 2500–800 BC)</strong> and <strong>Iron Age (c. 800 BC–AD 400)</strong>, Fife’s landscape filled with burial cairns, standing stones,
      and fortified hilltops. Among the most important was <strong>East Lomond Hillfort</strong>, just 15 miles north of Kinghorn, which became a major regional stronghold.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="picts">
    <h4>The Pictish Kingdom of Fife</h4>
    <p>
      By the first centuries AD, Fife formed part of the Pictish world. The <strong>Picts</strong> were not newcomers, but the descendants of earlier Iron Age peoples,
      organised into a network of tribal provinces. Fife itself was known as the <strong>Kingdom of Fib (or Fibh)</strong>, one of the seven traditional provinces of Pictland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HUYzj8hSSXvw89Ii2gXj88hzhu_6pH7w/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">East Lomond Hillfort</a>  appears to have been a key centre of power, guarding the routes between the Tay, the Forth, and the fertile coastlines. Kinghorn, with its
      farmland, fresh water, and access to the Forth, may have served as a local settlement during this time, though direct archaeological evidence remains limited.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="alba">
    <h4>The Emergence of Alba (9th–11th Centuries)</h4>
    <p>
      In the <strong>9th century</strong>, the Picts and the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata were united under <em>Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín)</em>.
      Tradition regards him as the first <strong>King of Scotland</strong>, although modern historians suggest this was more a gradual political and cultural fusion than a single act
      of conquest. This new kingdom of <strong>Alba</strong> marked the end of the Picts as a distinct people, though their legacy lived on in place names, stone monuments, and
      regional identities.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the union, Fife retained its importance as one of the heartlands of Alba. The old Pictish province of Fib evolved into the <strong>Mormaerdom of Fife</strong> —
      an early medieval earldom ruled by powerful local nobles. The Mormaers of Fife were among the most influential figures in the kingdom, traditionally holding the right to
      inaugurate Scotland’s kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 9th–11th centuries also saw the threat of <strong>Viking raids</strong> along Scotland’s east coast. While no direct records survive of attacks on Kinghorn, coastal settlements
      in Fife would have been vulnerable. Defensible sites — perhaps the origins of later fortifications at Kinghorn — may have developed in response to this insecurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the <strong>11th century</strong>, Kinghorn lay firmly within the realm of Alba. Its fertile lands and strategic location on the Forth made it a natural candidate for later royal
      attention, setting the stage for its medieval prominence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="high-middle">
    <h4>Kinghorn in the High Middle Ages (12th–13th Centuries)</h4>
    <p>
      Kinghorn’s rise to prominence began in the <strong>12th century</strong>, when the kings of Scotland increasingly looked to Fife as a royal heartland.
      The area around Kinghorn became a favoured royal hunting ground, valued for its fertile lands and proximity to the Forth, which offered swift access to Edinburgh and Stirling.
    </p>
    <p>
      This royal patronage led to the construction of a castle at Kinghorn. The precise location remains debated, but evidence suggests it stood near the Loch Burn —
      the area now occupied by <strong>Burt Avenue</strong>. By the mid-13th century, Kinghorn had grown into a settlement of real importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <strong>1285</strong>, King Alexander III granted a confirmatory charter, elevating Kinghorn to the status of a <strong>Royal Burgh</strong> — among the earliest in Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tragedy struck in <strong>1286</strong>, when Alexander III died after falling from his horse while travelling from Edinburgh to Kinghorn Castle. His sudden death, close to the town,
      left Scotland without a clear heir and plunged the kingdom into a succession crisis that ultimately led to the Wars of Independence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="schank">
    <h4>The Schank Tradition</h4>
    <p>
      Local tradition holds that <strong>Murdoch Schank</strong>, a member of the ancient Schank family of Midlothian, discovered and cared for Alexander’s body after his fatal fall.
      In recognition of this service, <strong>Robert the Bruce</strong> is said to have rewarded Murdoch with lands at <strong>Castlerigg in Kinghorn</strong> in 1319. The genealogy of the
      Schank family can be traced from this period through to the 19th century (see historical references below).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="lyon">
    <h4>Kinghorn Castle and the Lyon Family</h4>
    <p>
      In the later medieval period, Kinghorn Castle passed into the hands of the <strong>Lyon family</strong>, hereditary lords of <strong>Glamis Castle</strong> in Angus.
      It is likely that this connection led to the Kinghorn stronghold being referred to locally as “<em>Glamis Tower</em>” or “<em>Glamis Castle</em>”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The castle changed hands several times during the later Middle Ages. At one stage it was reportedly garrisoned by <strong>French troops</strong>, who used it as a defensive position during
      conflicts with Reformation forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      By <strong>1606</strong>, the Lyon family’s position was further elevated when <strong>Patrick Lyon</strong> was created <strong>Earl of Kinghorne</strong> by King James VI.
      Contemporary records note that the castle was by then in ruinous condition, with only its walls remaining.
    </p>

  <section id="summary">
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      From the first hunter-gatherers who camped along the coast 10,500 years ago, through the Pictish province of Fib, the union of the Scots and Picts, and the rise of Alba,
      Kinghorn’s landscape has been tied to the wider story of Scotland. By the 12th century, it had become a favoured royal retreat, a fortified settlement, and later a Royal Burgh.
      Its castle, long associated with the Lyon family of Glamis, stood as both a symbol of royal authority and a witness to the town’s central role in Scotland’s medieval history.

<h4>Unveiling ceremony King Alexander III Monument</h4>
    
<p>Prominent figures present at the unveiling ceremony included Senator James G. Blaine, a distinguished Republican who served as the United States Secretary of State in two separate terms, first from 1881 and then from 1889 to 1892. In June 1887, Senator Blaine, accompanied by his wife and daughters, embarked on a noteworthy European journey, exploring various countries. Their final destination was Scotland, where they were hosted at the summer residence of none other than Andrew Carnegie.</p>

<p>Carnegie, a Scottish-American industrialist, business magnate, and philanthropist born in Dunfermline, played a pivotal role in the late 19th-century expansion of the American steel industry. His remarkable success led him to become one of the wealthiest Americans in history.</p>

<p>Also in attendance was Lord Elgin, who received the esteemed Freedom of the Burgh of Kinghorn. Subsequently, he assumed the role of Viceroy of India from 1894 to 1899, adding another significant chapter to his distinguished career.</p>
