<h4>History</h4>
<p><b>Introduction<br>
Fife is now a very diffferent place compared to ancient times (see Sibbald's History of Fife below).  Over time agriculture has destroyed the woodlands that once covered the land.  Prehistorical Fife was occupied by tribes, notably the Picts and they were subsequently replaced by the Scots.  Kinghorn with it's abundant supply of fresh water and access to the marine resources of the Forth would have been a settlement for centuries.  Following the establishment of the Scottish monarchy Kinghorn became a favoured royal hunting ground and at some point possibly around the late 12th or 13th century a castle was built.  There is a question of where it was built but it is most likely to have been by the loch burn on the rising gound where Burt Avenue is now.   This castle is probably where Alexander 111 was returning to when he fell to his death in 1286.  It was eventually gifted to the Lyon family (Glamis Castle Angus) in the 15th century which is probably when it became known as Glamis Tower/Castle.  The castle swapped hands several times and it also appears to have been used as a defensive position by french troops who had been sent in to attack reformation forces.

The Reverend John Usher reporting in the Statistical Account of Scotland 1794 (see below) states "Upon a rising ground immediately behind the town, overlooking it, and commanding a view of the whole Firth of Forth, from Kinghorn downwards, and of all the opposite coast, there formerly stood a castle, the ruins of which were very lately to be seen, which was one of the ordinary seats of our ancient Kings.  This place of residence was probably chosen by the Scottish Monarchs, not only for the sake of the prospect which it commands, and the salubrity of the air, but for the conviency and pleasure of hunting.  For, tradition says, and the names of places in the neighbourhood confirm it (such as Woodfield-park, and Kingswood-end) that the ground behind the town, and to the westward, was once covered with wood".  The Reverend also floats the idea that the name Kinghorn was a result of the sound of the King's horn as the royal party went out hunting.</p><br>
