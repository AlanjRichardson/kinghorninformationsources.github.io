<h4>Home</h4>

<h4> A brief introduction </h4>

<p>I was born 1949 in the family home on Kinghorn High Street. At that time, the majority of the housing for working-class families was old and of poor quality, but thankfully many new council houses, such as Strathmore Street, Mid Road, Burnside Avenue, Orchard Road, and Croft n Righ were built or under construction. My birth allowed my family to get a council house, and we moved to Strathmore Street in late 1949.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, Kinghorn was a busy, mainly,working-class town where only a few families owned cars and private telephones were uncommon. The main source of entertainment was listening to BBC radio on valve sets that took several minutes to warm up. The town's cinema was also very well supported, especially the Saturday morning matinees. Televisions started appearing in a few homes in the mid 1950s and our family got one in 1959. Watching Raith Rovers at Starks Park was also a popular activity and the town had a thriving supporters club based at The Crown pub. There were several other drinking establishments including The Ship,The Auld Hoose, and Kinghorn Hotel.</p>

<p>As children we entertained ourselves by roaming all over Kinghorn and the surrounding areas on foot or on our bikes, playing freely and often getting up to no good.  Many of us, mainly boys, worked from the age of 12 to earn pocket money. As an example, I worked for Millars the Bakers as a delivery boy until I was 14, then for the Coop as a milk barrow boy. I also helped with the milking at Craigencalt farm and did summer jobs like leading beach rides on donkeys and carting holidaymakers' suitcases from the railway station. Public transport was at its peak, with Alexander's buses running frequently, often queueing to pick up and drop off Burntisland shipyard and Rosyth dockyard workers.</p>
<p> I finished school at 15 and worked for the NCB until I left Kinghorn in 1966 aged 17 and like many other Horners, who are scattered around the world, I still have an interest in the town. To share this interest, I have published this small website that provides global access to mainly historical information about Kinghorn. I hope you find it useful and enjoyable.</p>
