  <h4>Growing up in Kinghorn — a brief introduction</h4>

  <p>
    I was born in the spring of 1949, taking my first breath in the family home located in the Pend off 
    Kinghorn High Street. At that time, much of the housing available to working-class families was old 
    and of poor quality. Fortunately, the late 1940s saw the building of new council housing in streets 
    such as Strathmore Street, Mid Road, Burnside Avenue, Orchard Road, and Croft n Righ. My arrival made 
    our family eligible for a council house, and we moved to Strathmore Street later that same year.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the 1950s, Kinghorn was a busy, predominantly working-class town with a thriving High Street and 
    many small shops. Car ownership was rare, and very few households had a private telephone. Entertainment 
    centred on BBC radio, listened to on valve sets that took time to warm up. The local cinema was especially 
    popular, particularly the Saturday morning matinees. Television began to appear in some homes during 
    the early-1950s, reaching our household in 1959.
  </p>

  <p>
    Football was another important part of local life. Many people followed Raith Rovers at Stark’s Park, 
    with an active supporters’ club based at The Crown pub. Numerous other pubs — including The Ship, 
    The Auld Hoose, and the Kinghorn Hotel — formed an important part of the town’s social fabric.
  </p>

  <p>
    As children, we had great freedom, roaming Kinghorn and the surrounding area on foot or by bicycle, 
    often getting up to harmless mischief. Many of us, particularly boys, took part-time jobs from around 
    the age of twelve. I worked as a delivery boy for Millar’s the Bakers until I was fourteen, then moved 
    to the Co-op as a milk barrow boy. I also helped with milking at Craigencalt Farm and took on seasonal 
    work such as leading donkey rides on the beach and carrying visitors’ suitcases from the railway station.
  </p>

  <p>
    For most families, the main wage earners travelled daily to larger towns such as Kirkcaldy, Burntisland, 
    Rosyth, and Edinburgh. Public transport was at its peak, with frequent passenger and goods trains running 
    north to Dundee and Aberdeen and south to Edinburgh. This was the closing chapter of the steam railway era. 
    One of my strongest memories is standing with friends on the station footbridge, surrounded by smoke as 
    trains arrived and departed.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also remember Alexander’s buses lining up to collect and return workers from Burntisland shipyard and 
    the naval dockyard at Rosyth. The regular ebb and flow of these buses captures, for me, the industrial 
    rhythm of the period.
  </p>

  <p>
    I left school at fifteen and worked for the National Coal Board until leaving Kinghorn in 1966 at the age 
    of seventeen. Like many former residents now scattered around the world, I have retained a strong 
    interest in the town. To share that interest, I have created this website, which provides open access 
    to historical material relating to Kinghorn. I hope you find it both useful and enjoyable.
