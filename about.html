  <h3>About this Site</h3>

  <p>
    This website is a long-term, independent record of the history, people, places, industries, and everyday life of Kinghorn. It has been built up over many years using original photographs, documents, and personal recollections, with care taken to ensure accuracy and transparency of sources.
  </p>

  <p>
    The site is deliberately simple and lightweight, and is published using GitHub Pages so that it remains easy to maintain and accessible over time. It is not a crowd-edited site; material is added and checked offline to preserve consistency and reliability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Photographs are restored and annotated using non-destructive methods, particularly where individuals have been identified. This approach allows names and background information to be corrected or expanded as new evidence comes to light.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Stewardship and continuity</strong></p>

  <p>
    The site is maintained by a single individual and is structured so that it can, if necessary, be maintained or taken over by another technically competent custodian. While actively maintained, it has also been designed with long-term continuity in mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    For those curious about how the site is assembled, or with a technical interest, the source repository is publicly available:
