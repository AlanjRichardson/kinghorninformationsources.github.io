    <h3>About this Site</h3>
    
<p>This website is a long-term, independent record of the history, people, places, industries and everyday life of Kinghorn. It has been built up over many years using original photographs, documents and personal recollections, with care taken to be accurate and open about sources.

The site is deliberately simple and lightweight, and is published using GitHub Pages so that it can remain easy to maintain and accessible over time. It is not a crowd-edited site; material is added and checked offline to keep things consistent and reliable.

Photographs are restored and annotated using non-destructive methods, particularly where individuals have been identified. This allows names and background information to be corrected or added as new evidence comes to light.</p>
<p><strong>Stewardship and continuity</strong></p>

<p>The site is maintained by a single individual and is structured so that it can be understood and looked after by someone else in the future if needed. It is actively maintained, but has also been designed with long-term continuity in mind.

For anyone who is curious about how the site is put together, or who has a technical interest, the source repository is publicly available:
