    <h3>About this Site</h3>

<p></p>This website is a long-term, independent record of the history, people, places, industries and everyday life of Kinghorn. It has been developed and maintained over many years using original photographs, documents, and personal recollections, with an emphasis on accuracy, transparency, and preservation.  The site is intentionally static and lightweight, published via GitHub Pages to maximise longevity and ease of maintenance. All content is curated rather than crowd-edited.

Image restoration and annotation work — particularly the identification of individuals in historic photographs — is carried out using non-destructive workflows so that names and contextual information can be corrected or expanded as new evidence emerges.

Stewardship and continuity
The site is maintained by a single individual and is designed to be understandable, transferable, and preservable. While it is actively maintained, it is also structured so that it could, if necessary, be taken over by another technically competent custodian with an interest in local history and digital preservation.

For those curious about the technical structure or wishing to understand how the site is assembled, the source repository is publicly available:
