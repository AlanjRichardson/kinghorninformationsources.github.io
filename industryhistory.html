<h4>Industrial &amp; Commercial</h4>
<p>KInghorn's royal patronage faded and as a consequence so did it's fortunes, to the extent that before the industrial revolution the town was in a sorry state, it was poor and rundown and some of the residents had a bad reputation for exploiting the Midlothian ferry passengers arriving and departing from Pettycur harbour.</p>

<li>Dysart for coal and saut</li>
<li>Pathhead for meat and maut</li>
<li>Kirkcaldy for lassies braw</li>
<li>Kinghorn for breaking the law</li><br>

<p>Fortunately, Kinghorn was well placed to benefit from the industrial revolution being blessed with a good sized Loch to supply industry with water and a shoreline on the Firth of Forth that
gave access to the world’s oceans.  In the late 18th century the Loch attracted in the Mills. They used it’s water and it’s burn’s 100 foot drop to the Forth as a power source. </p>

<p>The coming of the railway in 1847 ended the era of the Pettycur to Midlothian ferries. It also brought in many new manufacturers to Kinghorn. The Scotsman 18th October 1886 reported that “The Binnend Oil Company has acquired from Kinghorn Town Council a piece of ground near the Loch to erect a candle factory operations to start immediately. Proximity to the new railway; which is being rushed forward, and the loch burn required for cooling purposes has determined the choice of site.”</p>

<p>Other examples: The site of Abden Shipyard was right next to the main railway line and a siding was created to supply the yard with materials; The Bottleworks again was built conveniently near the main railway line and a siding was constructed to provide transport of materials and products.</p>

<p>These industries and others, such as, Gibson’s Cleekworks, the Glue Works and the Tannery attracted workers from other areas of Scotland. These workers increased the
population and boosted the local economy thus helping create the Kinghorn we know today.</p>
