<h4>Industrial &amp; Commercial</h4>
    <p>KInghorn's royal patronage faded and as a consequence so did it's fortunes, to the extent that before the industrial revolution the town was in a sorry state, it was poor and rundown and some of the residents had a bad reputation for exploiting the Midlothian ferry passengers arriving and departing from Pettycur harbour as shown by this short extract from the Journal of Alexander Wilson (Poet, Ornithologist and contemporary of Robert Burns).  He visited Kinghorn on the 29th September 1789.   <blockquote> "Kinghorn is but a small place.......  The town is composed of an irregular assemblage of poor, low, ruinous, tile-covered huts but if miserable without still more so within.  Almost every home  being so dark, black and dirty, that I wrong them not to call each the cave of misery and desolation.  The inhabitants are almost all Boatmen and their whole commerce being with strangers  whom perhaps they may never see again, makes them avaricious, and always on the catch."</blockquote></p>
<p>The rest of Fife had an equally dim view of the borough, for example:</p>

<blockquote>"Dysart for coal and saut<br>
Pathhead for meat and maut<br>
Kirkcaldy for lassies braw<br>
Kinghorn for breaking the law"</blockquote>
  
  <p>However, Kinghorn's natural resources positioned it to reap the benefits of the industrial revolution. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, several flax mills were constructed, attracted by the power source provided by the Loch's storage capacity and its burn's 100-foot drop to the Forth.  This quote by the Reverend Fergus Jardine from the  <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R6ICAAAAMAAJ&amp;vq=contents&amp;pg=PA800&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=contents&amp;f=false" target="_blank"> Statisical Accounts 1843.</a> shows the impact of the Industry on the town:  <blockquote>"Few places have undergone such a transformation during the last thirty years as Kinghorn. Its streets were then almost impassable, they are now levelled and well paved. Its public buildings were mean,—they are now good. The former town-house was an ancient ecclesiastical building, the present town house and jail is of Gothic architecture, which cost the burgh £2500.  The schoolhouse was formerly a plain unpretending building; the schoolhouse now, and the grounds adjoining would do honour to the metropolis."</blockquote> 
    <p>The advent of the railway in 1847 marked the end of the Pettycur to Midlothian ferries and ushered in a new wave of prosperity for Kinghorn, notable examples are, the Abden Shipyard strategically located between the shoreline and the main railway line, complete with a siding for the efficient supply of materials. Similarly, the Bottleworks was built near the main railway line, with a dedicated siding for the transportation of both raw materials and finished products. On the 18th of October 1886 "The Scotsman" reported that the Binnend Oil Company were opening a Candle factory built on land acquired from Kinghorn Town Council the Company had also constructed a railway line, linking the factory to both the Binnend (Burntisland) Shale Works and Kinghorn Station on the main railway route.  The factory's location was determined by its proximity to the Loch's waters, required for cooling processes.</p>


<p>These emerging industries, including Gibson's Cleekworks, the Glue Works, and the Tannery, acted as magnets for skilled labour from various regions of Scotland. The influx of workers not only swelled the local population but also gave a significant boost to the local economy, contributing to the formation of the vibrant Kinghorn we recognise today.</p>
