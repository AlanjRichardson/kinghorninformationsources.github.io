    <h4>Industrial &amp; Commercial</h4>

    <p>
      Kinghorn's royal patronage faded and as a consequence so did its fortunes; to the extent that before the industrial
      revolution the town was in a sorry state. It was poor and rundown and some of the residents had a bad reputation for
      exploiting the Midlothian ferry passengers arriving and departing from Pettycur harbour. The following short extract
      is from the Journal of Alexander Wilson (poet and ornithologist), who visited Kinghorn on 29 September 1789:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <i>
        "Kinghorn is but a small place....... The town is composed of an irregular assemblage of poor, low, ruinous,
        tile-covered huts but if miserable without still more so within. Almost every home being so dark, black and dirty,
        that I wrong them not to call each the cave of misery and desolation. The inhabitants are almost all Boatmen and
        their whole commerce being with strangers whom perhaps they may never see again, makes them avaricious, and always
        on the catch."
      </i>
    </blockquote>

    <ul class="poem">
      <li><i><b>"Dysart for coal and saut</b></i></li>
      <li><i><b>Pathhead for meat and maut</b></i></li>
      <li><i><b>Kirkcaldy for lassies braw</b></i></li>
      <li><i><b>Kinghorn for breaking the law"</b></i></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      However, Kinghorn's natural resources positioned it to reap the benefits of the industrial revolution. In the late 18th
      and early 19th centuries, several flax mills were constructed, attracted by the power source provided by the Loch's
      storage capacity and its burn's 100-foot drop to the Forth. The following quote by the Reverend Fergus Jardine from the
      <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R6ICAAAAMAAJ&amp;vq=contents&amp;pg=PA800&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=contents&amp;f=false"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical Accounts 1843</a> shows the impact of industry on the town:
      <q>Few places have undergone such a transformation during the last thirty years as Kinghorn. Its streets were then
      almost impassable, they are now levelled and well paved. Its public buildings were mean,—they are now good. The former
      town-house was an ancient ecclesiastical building, the present town house and jail is of Gothic architecture, which cost
      the burgh £2500. The schoolhouse was formerly a plain unpretending building; the schoolhouse now, and the grounds
      adjoining would do honour to the metropolis.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      The advent of the railway in 1847 marked the end of the Pettycur to Midlothian ferries and ushered in a new wave of
      prosperity for Kinghorn — notable examples are the Abden Shipyard (strategically located between the shoreline and the
      main railway line, complete with a siding) and the Bottleworks (built near the main line and with its own siding). On
      18 October 1886 <i>The Scotsman</i> reported that the Binnend Oil Company were opening a candle factory built on land
      acquired from Kinghorn Town Council; the company had also constructed a railway line linking the factory to both the
      Binnend (Burntisland) Shale Works and Kinghorn Station. The factory's location was determined by its proximity to the
      Loch's waters, required for cooling processes.

      These emerging industries, including Gibson's Cleekworks, the Glue Works, and the Tannery, acted as magnets for skilled
      labour from various regions of Scotland. The influx of workers not only swelled the local population but also boosted the
      local economy, contributing to the formation of the vibrant Kinghorn we recognise today.
