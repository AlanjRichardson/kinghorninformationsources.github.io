# Kinghorn Information Sources

This repository hosts the **Kinghorn Information Sources** website, maintained by  
Alan Richardson.

The site brings together material on the people, places, industries, natural
history, maps, and everyday life of Kinghorn, using text, photographs, and
archival sources built up over many years.

It is intended as a long-term, independent historical record rather than a
general-purpose blog or wiki.

The site is published using GitHub Pages and is intentionally static and
lightweight, with an emphasis on longevity, clarity, and ease of maintenance.

------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------

## Supporting documents

All supporting documents referenced across the site (primarily PDF files) are
stored directly within the repository’s `data/` directory and are served locally
via GitHub Pages. This avoids reliance on third-party hosting, ensures long-term
link stability, and keeps primary source material closely coupled to the pages
that reference it.

Taken together, these documents form a small, self-contained reference library
intended to complement and extend the narrative content of the site.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Photos with Names – gallery system

The *Photos With Names* gallery is driven entirely by structured data generated
offline. The public-facing site is read-only.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Source of truth

The authoritative source for named photographs is a LibreOffice spreadsheet:

data/photo_names_sorted.ods


This file contains:
- Surname
- Full name
- Photo file name

All downstream files used by the gallery are generated from this spreadsheet.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Python environment

The Python scripts require a virtual environment.

One-time setup (from the repository root):

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Use as required:

source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/make_people_js.py
python scripts/make_people_index.py

The scripts will warn if the virtual environment is not active.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Workflow: adding new photos

Follow these steps **in order**.

### Step 1 – Add the full-size photo

Copy the image into:

photos-with-names/full/

File naming rules:
- Include a year where possible (e.g. `School1948.jpg`)
- If multiple photos exist for a year, suffix with a letter:
  `School1948a.jpg`, `School1948b.jpg`
- Use consistent spelling and casing
- Always include the `.jpg` extension

------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 2 – Update the spreadsheet

Edit:

data/photo_names_sorted.ods

Add one row per identified person.

Rules:
- Use the **exact** filename, including `.jpg`
- Multiple people may reference the same photo
- Correct spelling errors here, not later

------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 3 – Generate `people-data.js`

Run:

python scripts/make_people_js.py

This overwrites:

js/people-data.js

It also creates or updates:

photos-with-names/thumbnails/

Thumbnails are generated automatically from the full-size images.

**Do not edit this file manually.**

------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 4 – Generate the photo index

Run:

python scripts/make_people_index.py

This produces:

photos-with-names/people-index.json

This file:
- Deduplicates photos
- Extracts years from filenames
- Aggregates names per photo
- Powers gallery searching and filtering

------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 5 – Commit and publish

git add .
git commit -m "Add new named photos"
git push

GitHub Pages updates automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Gallery search behaviour

- **Year search** (e.g. `1948`)
  - Shows each photo once
  - No names shown
  - Intended for visual browsing

- **Name search** (e.g. `Richardson`)
  - Shows matching photos
  - Caption shows full names only
  - No duplicate photo tiles

- **Empty search**
  - Shows all photos
  - Caption shows filename (no extension)

------------------------------------------------------------

## Read-only design

The public gallery is intentionally read-only.  
All editing and correction happens offline via the spreadsheet and scripts.

This approach protects historical accuracy and internal consistency.

------------------------------------------------------------

## War Memorial – epitaphs system

The War Memorial pages link individual names to a shared epitaph display page
(`epitaph.html`). Each name link includes a unique identifier which is used to
load the correct epitaph content.

Epitaph text and related information are stored in:

js/epitaphs-data.js

This file is maintained manually. New epitaphs, corrections, or additions are
edited directly in the JavaScript file; there is no automated generation step for
this part of the site.

This reflects the small, sensitive nature of the material and allows careful
control over wording and presentation.

------------------------------------------------------------

## Maintenance rules

- Always fix filename or name errors in the spreadsheet first
- Regenerate downstream files after every change
- Never manually edit:
  - `people-data.js`
  - `people-index.json`

------------------------------------------------------------

## Image working files

High-resolution GIMP (`.xcf`) files are retained locally as authoritative working
masters. These preserve editable text layers (names) and annotations so that
identifications and information can be corrected or expanded over time.

Only exported JPEG derivatives are included in this repository.
