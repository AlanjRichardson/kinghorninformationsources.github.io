<H3>Firth of Forth</H3>



<p><i>Significance: a&nbsp;valley carved below sea level by the Forth ice stream 
and drowned by post-glacial sea level rise</i></p>

<p>The firths of the east coast of Scotland are fjörds - the valleys have been 
over-deepened by glacial erosion and subsequently invaded by the sea.&nbsp; 
During the cold stages of the Pleistocene ice advanced from the south-west 
Highlands and was channelled through the existing Forth valley at Stirling. 
Erosion was most intense beneath the zone of most rapid flow of the ice stream, 
particularly where the ice was funnelled between the Ochils and the high ground 
south of Cambusbarron.</p>
<p>The Firth of Forth is a broad funnel-shaped fjörd. Beneath the estuary and its 
sediments lies a rock floor that locally extends well below sea level.&nbsp;Careful collation of borehole records by Brian Sissons has revealed the complex form of the rock head profile of the Forth 
Valley.&nbsp; West of Stirling rock basins have been gouged from the soft 
Carboniferous sedimentary rocks to a depth of 200 m below present sea level.&nbsp; The resistant sill 
on which Stirling Castle sits has been lowered, dissected and streamlined. Deep tunnel valleys, 
probably cut by glacial meltwater moving under pressure, run along the 
foot of the Ochils and down the axis of the Firth of Forth.&nbsp; The deepest 
part of the Forth valley is off Grangemouth, where rockhead lies at z metres below sea 
level.&nbsp; Other basins occur upstream of the Forth Bridge and sea bed east of 
the bridge has high relief, with the islands of Inchcolm, Inchcape, Cramond and 
others rising abruptly from a sea floor at -20 m.  East of Edinburgh the floor of the Firth of Forth generally lies around -40 m, only deepening 
to -60 m off St Abbs. Rockhead generally lies only 10-15 m beneath the sea bed. 
The deepest part of Firth swings around the headland at North Berwick.</p>


<p>The shores of the Firth of Forth show a sequence of raised beaches which provide a 
detailed record of the pattern and timing of sea level change during and after 
ice retreat. On the floor of the Forth the muddy sediments of the St Abbs and 
Forth Formations record the change from glacimarine to marine sedimentation over 
the past 15,000 years (Gatliff, <i>et al.,</i> 1994).</p>
